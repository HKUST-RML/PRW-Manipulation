  By not providing "Findapriltagscpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "apriltagscpp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "apriltagscpp" with
  any of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "apriltagscpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "apriltagscpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "apriltagscpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
