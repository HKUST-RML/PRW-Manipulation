# *rockwalk*

## 0. Overview
***rockwalk*** is an efficient technique to transport large objects with a (roughly) circular base. A simple passive end-effector *cages* the object at a point off its rolling axis, while the robot relocates the end-effector sideways to rock the object. This causes the object to take (small) traverse steps during each rocking motion, in much the same way as the *parallel-parking* manoeuvre. In fact, this technique is motivated by an archaelogical [study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5YR0uqPAI8) which suggested that the massive *Moai* statues of Easter Island might have been transported by rocking them with long cables.
